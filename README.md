# HR-Diversity-and-Inclusion
This project is part of the PwC Switzerland Power BI Virtual Case Experience and focuses on analyzing HR data to assess workforce diversity and inclusion. The task simulated a real-world consulting scenario where I was asked to help a client understand their diversity metrics and identify areas for improvement.

Using Power BI, I cleaned and transformed the dataset, built interactive dashboards, and visualized key insights across gender, ethnicity, age group, and department. The dashboard includes filters, slicers, and KPIs to help HR professionals drill down into workforce composition and identify diversity gaps or biases in hiring and promotions.

Key metrics analyzed include gender balance, ethnic representation, and seniority distribution across teams. The project emphasizes data storytelling to make complex HR metrics easily understandable for decision-makers, with visual insights that support inclusive hiring and development strategies.

ðŸ”§ Skills Used: Power BI, Data Cleaning, DAX, HR Analytics, Data Visualization

ðŸ’¼ Outcome: Delivered a professional HR dashboard with actionable insights to guide strategic D&I decisions and foster a more inclusive workplace.
